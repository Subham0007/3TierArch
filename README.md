# 3TierArch
This is a 3 tier architecture  demo for .net frame work.

I created this demo arch. in visual studio 2012.
the framework is 4.0

1.1st I created an empty website in visual studio.

2. then in that web site I created a web form according to my requirement.

3. after that I created 2 partial classes named BL and DAL.

4. I added DAL reference to BL and then BL reference to My website.


to open this project in visual studio...you have to open the three-tier\Project\3Tier\3Tier.sln file
In some cases only BL and DAL will load...so in that case change the website path accordingly(from the error path).

And in the connection strig(DAL/Class1) please insert your DB name and password etc to run this project.
